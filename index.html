                            <p class="card-text">The growing urban population makes road congestion a significant barrier to timely emergency medical care, underscoring the importance of finding creative solutions. The Ambulance Clearance in Traffic (ACT) system and the Challan for Obstructive Vehicles (COV) system are two essential components of the overall solution to handle this dilemma that is presented in this article. The research also suggests an application that would improve patient access and accountability for ambulance drivers.In order to identify crowded locations and provide ambulances the best alternate routes, the ACT system makes use of real-time traffic data, GPS, and sophisticated algorithms. This reduces response times and maximizes the flow of emergency vehicles in urban environments. </p>
